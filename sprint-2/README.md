# Sprint 2

## Sprint Tasks
In this sprint we created the basic UI for our application, which will allow a user to login, select a repo, and view some dummy data on a map. Our work items are as folllows:
  - Login feature (https://www.josephcvitale.com/swe/login.html)
  - Repo Selection (API component)
  - Map Visualization (UI component)

## Intended Design
This application is intented to allow an authorized user to view locational data about a repository. It will show all available locations of contributors, which will be visualized with pins on a map. Further visualizaitons will be experimented with, such as showing how contribution locations change over time.
